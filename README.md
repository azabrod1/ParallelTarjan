# ParallelTarjan


Lock Free Parallelization of Tarjanâ€™s Algorithm

This project was done for my MSc in Computer Science at Oxford with Gavin Lowe as my supervisor (full Acknowledgments and references in the other pdf). I am placing the code and the associated dissertation on github for reference in case it can be useful to someone.

/**
 Pre:    The searches S0,S1, S2, S3,...,Sn are in a blocking cycle such that
         So --> S1 -->  S2 --> S3 -->...--> Sn
         Cells are being transferred from S0 to Sn-1 to Sn to resolve the cycle
 
 Inputs: src is one of the searches Si from S0 to Sn-1
         dest is the search Sn that is recieving the transferred cell
         conflict cell is the cell of src the search before src, S_{i-1} is blocked on and
         corresponds to the cell Ci in the paper
 
 Purpose: First, The function transfers cells from the tarjanStack of src to the tarjanStack of dest.
          Cell transfer starts at the top of src's tarjanStack and proceeds until the following two conditons are met
          a) The conflict cell is transferred to dest
          b) The last cell transferred has rank no greater than the minimum rank of the cells transferred so far
 
          ...a) is important because we want to transfer the cell causing the conflict to dest so that the conflict is 
          resolved. b) is important because we want to transfer all the cells in the same SCC as the conflict cell
          otherwise dest and src will both have some cells in that SCC on their stack, and hence they will again collide
          and form a cycle
 
          defining L to be the is the last cell we transferred from src's tarjanStack,
          we transfer all the cells in src's control stack starting from its top and 
          proceeding until we reach L. Note that L must be on src's controlStack. To see why, note that
          L.index must equal L.rank otherwise it would be impossible for L to have index lower than 
          any rank encountered so far since its own index will be less than its rank.
 
 Post:    The relevant cells discussed above are tranferred to dest with their index and rank variables updated to
          fit with their new stack. The search src is now blocked on the last cell transferred to dest

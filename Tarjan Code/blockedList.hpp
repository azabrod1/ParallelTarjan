/**The BlockedList provides a lock-free data structure to store the searches blocked on each cell
  
  The data structure has an initial capacity of 2^P. The idea is to choose a P so that the blockedList
  rarely exceeds size 2^P and then optimize the list so that writing and reading these first 2^P elements is 
  is very fast.
 
  The initial buffer, firstBuffer, is a member variable of the class. This allows us to avoid pointer ndirection
  and extra mallocs by having the buffer's memory allocated as part of BlockedList
 
  Should the size of the list exceed capacity, blockedList allocates a new buffer of size
  sizeOfLastBuffer*(2^P). The elements in the old buffers are not moved, we simply use the old buffers
  in addition to the new ones. We hold a master List, 'buffers', which holds pointers to all the 
  auxilary buffers that needed to be allocated. The 'buffers' array is only allocated if the firstBuffer's
  capacity is exhausted with a compare_and_exchange(null, new AtomicPointerArray).
 
  New buffers are also allocated with a compare_and_exchange.
   
  The N_BUFS variable provides a limit on the total number of buffers can be allocated; going over the limit would
   result in an error.
 
  Items are inserted with the push_back(item) function. Items are inserted in order, the first one at index 0, second
  at index 1 and so on. 
 
  The atomic member variable 'head' gives the index of the last element inserted. To insert a new element,
  a thread calls getAndIncrement() on head which returns the index the thread should insert the new element.
 
  After receiving an index, we retrive the corresponding buffer the index is associeted with an then
  convert the index into a position on the buffer. We precompute some calculations to speed up these conversions
  and store them in the static arrays sums[] and powers[]. The initSums() function 
  does these calculations for each template once when the class is initialized in the beginning of
  the program
 
  When a cell becomes complete, it calls unsuspendAll() which iterates through its BlockedList to find
  out which searches may be blocked on the cell. When head < size of firstBuffer = BASE, all of 
  the elements are in the firstBuffer. In this case, unsuspendAll() simply iterates though the entries of the firstBuffer
  If head >= BASE, we know some of the auxilary buffers contain entries as well. In that case, we use a 
  blockedList iterator to read all the values in the data structure. It is possible to use the iterator 
  to retrive all the values in the list even when head < BASE, but it is a good optimization to avoid the neccesary overhead
  when possible.
 
  The blockedList does not support a delete operation. Instead when a cell finds a search in the blockedList,
  it verifies that the cell is actually complete before unsuspending the search. 
 
  The reset() operation should be called each time a cell is recycled to clear the contents of all the buffers

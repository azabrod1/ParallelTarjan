/** When a search encounters a vertex on the graph, it needs to check whether a Cell object has already
been created to represent that vertex. If a cell object already exists for that node, we use this dictionary
to retreive it, otherwise we store an Node representing the cell in this dictionary. Because multiple threads may
 use the dictionary at once and may even try to add a node representing the same vertex concurrently,
 any implementation of this interface must be thread safe
